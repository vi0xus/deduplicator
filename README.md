#Simple Image Deduplicator
This script will remove any image duplicates you have in a specified folder, transfering any duplicate copies into their own 'dupes' folder.  Once a duplicate has been found, any additional duplicates of the same image will just be deleted.

`python deduplicator.py ./path/to/images`
